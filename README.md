# Data Structure in C++
I made this repository for learning [Data Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) in C++ Language. This repository includes programs that contain explanation of data linkage in C++. That there are different ways to link data.
I have made following structure in C++.
## Structures
* Stack
* Queue
* List  

All these structures are using a cNode class which is also included in this repo. This Repository contains Constructor, Destructor, Copy constructor, Operator Overloading, Adding or Removing, Reversing list, Push and Pop functions etc.
